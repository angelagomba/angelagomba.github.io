    self_portrait_1
    <p>In my high school photography class we had to complete a photo journal every week. The theme for this week in
    particular was to imitate the style of Vivian Dorothy Maier, an American street photographer from the 50s who
    worked 40 years as a nanny. In her photography collection, you will find self portraits of Maier that were taken
    through various reflective objects. My self_portrait_ series is my own interpretation of her style.</p>
