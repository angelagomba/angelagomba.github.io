                Computer Science
            </a>
            <p>
                A collection of coding projects I've done. Prior to college, I had no formal coding experience, which was
                both terrifying and exciting. Though I took a risk going into something I wasn't sure I'd be any good at,
                I had developed an interest and curiosity in the field during my high school years. It began with simply
                playing around with the html code of my Tumblr blogs, and I soon asked myself, "What else could be made with
                lines of code?" Technology has begun to permeate all aspects of our lives, as well as numerous industries.
                One that I grew a curiosity towards was health and technology. I came across this video of a woman computer
                scientist who had coded a device that undid the effects of Parkinson's disease, and the woman she had made
                the device for was moved to tears when she could simply write her name again and draw a straight line. After
                I saw that video, I knew that I wanted to one day be a part of something as important as that, and saw that
                computer science was the way to achieve that. Until then, here is a working collection of what I've been
                able to create so far.

            </a>
            <p>
                It's hard to write a short bio about writing. That being said, I won't waste my time, or yours. This
                portfolio is a sample of some of my writing. Enjoy :~)

                Photography
            </a>
            <p>
                Despite my lack in professional skill, this portfolio is my life. I think of friends
                and family, and I see the photos I've taken of them. I despair over heartbreak and loss, and I hold onto
                the past in a picture. I wonder about the strangers I've photographed, and how just mere milliseconds of a
                snapshot have brought life to my work. This is my life, photography to me.

                Advertising
            </a>
            <p>
                Before I decided to go the STEM route, I thought I was going to go to art school for college. So in
                preparation for art school, I took some online classes with the Academy of Art University over the
                course of 2 summers. One of the classes I took was advertising. At the time, I was binge watching
                Mad Men on Netflix, so it was very fitting to be learning about the interesting craft and profession
                of advertising. I excelled in my class, receiving some of the highest marks in my class, and praise
                from my Professor. At the end of the course, I was one of 2 people who received an 'A' in the class, and
                my Professor had even offered to write me a letter of recommendation. Despite my success, I did not
                enjoy it. Everything requires hard work, practice, patience, and some pain. Some good pains I've found
                in my life are practicing violin till my back hurts, playing guitar till my fingertips callous, and
                coding for hours with only a cup of coffee to keep me company. However, I am still proud of the work
                I put my time, effort, and creativity towards. Although advertising is not one of my good pains,
                it has become a pain I am proud of.
