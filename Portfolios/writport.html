                <br />
                She switches the last light off to go to bed,<br />
                and her room is only illuminated by the moonlight<br />
                that escapes the night sky and seeps through the slits of her window.<br />
                "That's beautiful" she thinks,<br />
                but soon enough questions the validity of that statement.<br />
                What she found beautiful was unnatural, not spontaneous.<br />
                It was the bare minimum of nature,<br />
                for it was only a light;<br />
                light, which man did not create,<br />
                but could reproduce.<br />
                What she saw was a rare sighting of nature making its way into her man-made dwelling,<br />
                amongst a jungle of more concrete buildings.<br />
                Concrete floors,<br />
                concrete walls,<br />
                all created by concrete minds,<br />
                minds filled with innovation.<br />
                Then she thought again.<br />
                It was beautiful.<br />
                In her concrete jungle she found people of concrete hearts and eyes that could not see,<br />
                eyes filled with concrete.<br />
                It wasn't that it was not beautiful,<br />
                but that no one else was looking where she was,<br />
                no one else could participate in this sighting,<br />
                because she was alone within the cold walls of her home.<br />
                The moonlight did not keep her warm;<br />
                in fact, its silver slivers made her cry cold tears<br />
                and she realized that her heart was frozen.<br />
                Her hardships had made her cold and unforgiving.<br />
                Her eyes filled with concrete, like everyone else,<br />
                judged others she didn't even know with cynicism.<br />
                Except now.<br />
                Crying in the moonlight had humbled her and made her realize how lonely she was,<br />
                and how she longed to share this secret,<br />
                this affair with the moon and the stars,<br />
                with someone else in order to open their concrete eyes.<br />
                The moonlight grew weaker as she watched it continue to seep through,<br />
                as if she was absorbing its luminous and mysterious beauty.<br />
                "I'll change the world one day," she thought,<br />
                "or at least, my world."<br />
                She kissed the moonlight farewell,<br />
                and before she drifted to dream,<br />
                she said, <i>"Goodnight, moon."</i><br />

                <br />
                Go and watch the ocean waves.<br />
                Sit at the edge of the top of the sand<br />
                and watch the love affair between the tide and the shore.<br />
                It comes close,<br />
                but it never touches you.<br />
                Your eyes draw to the horizon,<br />
                past the crashing waves,<br />
                and you picture yourself getting farther<br />
                and farther away from the shore.<br />
                There may be land out there,<br />
                but you don't have the courage to chase your daydreams.<br />
                The mist of the water layers over your body,<br />
                but you don't notice<br />
                because you wonder where the sun sets,<br />
                and why it kisses the water.<br />
                Your mind wanders out there,<br />
                and drowns your heart<br />
                ----------------------------<br />
                Go with the wind and reach the shore.<br />
                Crash just before,<br />
                and let the foam kiss the sand at the edge.<br />
                You come close,<br />
                but you never touch him.<br />
                Your eyes draw to him,<br />
                sitting atop the sand,<br />
                and you picture yourself reaching closer and closer to him.<br />
                He may sit there for a while,<br />
                but he's looking past you.<br />
                and you can only hope to unbury his toes from the sand.<br />
                You want to reach him,<br />
                but you don't have the strength of a tsunami;<br />
                and even if you did,<br />
                you wouldn't want to destroy what you touch.<br />
                You look back and see the sun kiss the water,<br />
                and curse the moon for not creating higher tides.<br />
                You turn back towards the shore,<br />
                and see he came closer,<br />
                stuck his feet in,<br />
                then ran away from the shore.<br />
            </p>

                August 14, 2017 @ 8:14pm<br />
                <br />
                It's been a year<br />
                since the ocean made me cry salt tears,<br />
                since I let the ocean drown my fears.<br />
                <br />
                The edge of the water soaks the sand,<br />
                and it's time for us to go across the land,<br />
                as we say our goodbyes to friends.<br />
                <br />
                We can't see the exchange of kisses,<br />
                the way the ocean catches the sun and misses,<br />
                but we throw our coins and make our wishes,<br />
                and the foam just hisses.<br />
                <br />
                Each day each hour each minute is spent,<br />
                wondering where our time together went,<br />
                how we plan to chase the dreams we slept,<br />
                but the ocean keeps our skin wet.<br />
                <br />
                As the wind blows the waves,<br />
                and our minds and hearts start to crave,<br />
                we wonder if we can be brave,<br />
                and exchange our sandy footprints for our futures to pave.<br />
                <br />
                It is no longer he and the shore,<br />
                but each of us yearning for more.<br />
                <br />
                A year ago he dipped his feet and ran from the shore,<br />
                but not out of greed or fear or because he wasn't sure<br />
                but because it wasn't his time to drown and venture,<br />
                and find the ocean's hidden treasures.<br />
                <br />
                The sea no longer chases us,<br />
                for we ride the wind like dust,<br />
                and the sea no longer curses the moon,<br />
                for we will all see each other soon.<br />

                June 10, 2016 @ 4:34am<br />
                <br />
                I'm all alone,<br />
                yet it's so noisy.<br />
                The thoughts that twist my brain and<br />
                break my heart are all too noisy.<br />
                But how couldI call them noisy,<br />
                when a whisper of my soul is no louder<br />
                than my heart screaming?<br />
                A composure made of soundproof glass is what keeps my sanity,<br />
                but the transparency of the glass can't hide my emotions,<br />
                my raging affliction.<br />
                She knows,<br />
                because she listens.<br />
                Her heart is not too far from her ears,<br />
                not like the others who gave theirs away<br />
                along with their compassion.<br />
                And soon I'll lose my hearing<br />
                because the affairs they have with their <br />
                own hearts are too loud.<br />
                And when I lose my auditory sense,<br />
                I'll lose communication,<br />
                even with myself.<br />
                No longer can I hear my own heart;<br />
                its screams just above a whisper.<br />
                In my state of isolation I wonder,<br />
                when did the nights stop comforting me?<br />
                Because now I feel as if I'm sleepwalking through my days,<br />
                and being along with my thoughts keep me from my slumber.<br />
                Enveloped in the dark I was content,<br />
                for I could paint the dark sky in dreams and desires.<br />
                But now I can't hear,<br />
                and the deafening cloak of the darkness<br />
                scares me as I wait for creatures to come devour me.<br />
                Hopefully they'll find my heart,<br />
                and maybe in an instance of danger<br />
                my heart will break its silence<br />
                and I'll hear again the person I was,<br />
                the girl who dreamt and hoped and loved.<br />
                But for now,<br />
                she's silent.<br />
                Her heart weeps,<br />
                but it's too noisy for her to listen to her own heart.<br />
                Looking through the sound proof glass<br />
                is a girl who smiles,<br />
                for that was the last thing her heart felt,<br />
                before it went silent.<br />
